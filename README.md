ChatDev is an innovative AI NPC gaming research platform poised to revolutionize virtual interactions among NPCs within meticulously crafted simulated social environments.

## Gameplay Rules

* Upon initial entry, based on your language environment, you become the protagonist in the simulated world.
* The simulated environment's timeline commences from the year 2040. When you launch the game, time begins to flow. As each day concludes, your memories remain intact, and you wake up in your bed to commence the next day's life, building upon historical recollections and the lives of 25 NPCs.
* Depending on your location, you can log your routine activities and acquire more information through inquiries.
* When in proximity to NPCs, they will initiate conversations based on current situations and prior dialogue history.
* Changes in your location and distance from NPCs contribute to summarizing your chats.

Looking ahead, our development focuses on two key areas:

1. **Diverse Model Interfaces:** Our commitment lies in introducing a wider range of state-of-the-art model interfaces to the platform. This expansion empowers users to delve deeper into the complexity of virtual social interactions, leveraging the strengths of various models to create genuinely immersive experiences.

2. **Elevated NPC Intelligence and Autonomy:** Our future vision involves enhancing the autonomy and intelligence of virtual NPCs within the gaming environment. By infusing greater diversity, these NPCs will exhibit refined behaviors and reactions, culminating in interactions that feel more authentic. This pursuit of heightened autonomy aligns with our mission to provide unparalleled gaming experiences.


Through these strategic initiatives, ChatDev aspires to redefine the AI-based gaming landscape, propelling virtual interactions to unprecedented levels of realism and intricacy.

    "prompt": "A computer that contains this knowledge: ## Prompt IDE\nPrompt flow is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation.    It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.\n\n- **Prompt Flow Editor**: Used to edit the YAML file of `Prompt Flow` and the prompt content and JavaScript script of the node\n- **Prompt Flow Visualization**: Through the visualization of the execution process of the Prompt Flow node, the color of the node will change when it is executed to a certain node\n- **JavaScript Support**: Through JavaScript scripts, you can use your creativity to realize the cooperation of different NPCs to achieve your GPTs\n- **Export & Import**: You can import other excellent GPTs or share your GPTs\n\n### PromptFow Editor\n\n- YAML syntax highlighting\n- automatic completion for NPCs name & Prompt Library.\n- dual screen display\n\nCreate and iteratively develop flow with PromptFow Editor\n- Create executable flows that link LLMs, prompts, **JavaScript** code and other tools together.\n- Debug and iterate your flows, especially the interaction with LLMs with ease.\n\nleft editor is the YAML file of PromptFlow, where `path` and `func` are highlighted, indicating that a custom Prompt is referenced. You can move the mouse and click on the node on `path` or `func`, and the right side will display the Prompt you customized on the node. The rightmost folded interface is the visual Prompt Flow. You can also edit the Prompt content of the node by double-clicking the node.\nWhen you modify the YAML file on the left, the visual Prompt Flow on the right will be updated in real time.\n\n\n### PromptFow visualization\nWhile how LLMs work may be elusive to many developers, how LLM apps work is not - they essentially involve a series of calls to external services such as LLMs/databases/search engines, or intermediate data processing, all glued together. Thus LLM apps are merely Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of function calls. These DAGs are flows in prompt flow.\nBy observing many internal use cases, we learned that deeper insight into the detail of the execution is critical. Establishing a systematic method for tracking interactions with external systems is one of design priority. Consequently, We adopted an unconventional approach - prompt flow has a YAML file describing how function calls (we call them Tools) are executed and connected into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n### Flows\n\nA flow in PromptFlow is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of prompts/functions, referred to as nodes. These nodes are connected via input/output dependencies and are executed based on the topology by the PromptFlow executor. A flow is represented as a YAML file and can be visualized using our IDE. Here is an example:\n\n* **outputs**\n\n```yaml\noutputs:\n  overview:\n    reference: ${TestModification}\n```\n\nIndicates the definition of the current node's output content. `${TestModification}` references the node's name, signifying that the current node's output is the output of the `TestModification` node (`output` variable).\n\n* **roles (optional)**\n\n```yaml\nroles:\n  - name: \"Chief Product Officer\"\n    npc: \"Mei Lin\"\n    source:\n      path: Role_Chief_Product_Officer\n```\n\nAn optional field defining the execution role for the current node. It includes the role's name, an optional NPC for visualization, and the definition of the role's prompt content.\n\n* **nodes**\n\n```yaml\nnodes:\n  - name: DemandUnderstand\n    source:\n      path: Planning_Prompt_Enhance\n      func: Func_Prompt_Enhance\n    inputs:\n      task: ${inputs.input_text}\n\n  - name: task_company\n    source:\n      path: Planning_Task_Company\n    inputs:\n      assistant_role: \"Chief Product Officer\"\n      task: ${DemandUnderstand.output}\n```\n\nThe crucial part of the entire PromptFlow, defining roles, content, and handling of return content. Nodes specify task execution roles, content, and the processing of returned content.\n\n### JavaScript Support\n\nJavaScript is a powerful language used for implementing complex prompting techniques in PromptFlow. It enables developers to implement intricate prompting techniques and rich analytics for visualizing PromptFlow outputs.\n\n* **Variable Scope**\n\n  * **Input Variables (inputs node):** `source.path` represents a custom prompt with unknown variables like `{xxx}`. For example, defining `task` as an input variable: `${DemandUnderstand.output}` replaces `{task}` in the prompt with `${DemandUnderstand.output}`.\n\n    * `task: ${inputs.input}`: Using a generic input local variable. `${inputs.input}` represents the complete content entered in the input box.\n    * `xxx: ${node_name.variable}`: Defining your input variable `xxx`, `${node_name.variable}` references a local variable in another node.\n  * **Output Variables:**\n\n    * `output`: Represents the complete content returned by a large model. Referenced in other nodes as `node_name.output`.\n    * `func`: Custom local variables defined in the `JavaScript` script of a node.\n  * **Variable Scope:** Local to the current node. Define variables using `let` or `const`.\n\n* **Exception Handling**\n\n  * Manually throw exceptions in `func` using `throw new Error(\"xxx\")`, where `xxx` is a custom prompt. When a node encounters an exception, it will output the exception information to the console.\n\n  * Manually throwing exceptions allows you to identify and fix issues in your code during execution.\n\n>**Important Note:** Avoid using `console.log(\"xxx\")` for logging, as `console` is not a global variable in the node's context.\n\n### Export & Import\nYou can export your prompt flow to a json file and import it to another devices. \nit contains all the information about your prompt flow, including the prompt, the JavaScript functions, and the YAML file."
